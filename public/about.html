  <p style="display:inline; color: rgb(249, 246, 241);">Hi! I'm not sure about giving away my real name, but you can call me Nathan. Presently, I'm <b>12 going for 13</b>!<br> I like the colours <div style="display:inline;color:blue;text-align: center;">ultramarine blue</div><div style="display: inline; color: rgb(245, 240, 232);text-align: center;"> and </div><div style="display:inline;color:green; text-align: center;">green</div><div style="display: inline; color: rgb(234, 233, 231);text-align: center;"> a lot, and I am fascinated by <b>physics, math and tech</b>, but enough<br> about me, let's get to my coding journey.</div></p>

<p style="text-align: center; display:inline;color:rgb(250, 248, 243)">Well, to talk about how I got started with coding, I will begin from when I was 10 years old. By the age of ten,<br> I had developed a rather keen interest towards math in specific. In 6th, when I was 11 years old, I started feeling<br> passion for computer science and specifically physics too. I was thinking about taking a course in programming<br> to be able to develop my own cool websites and apps and other functionalities I wanted to add to my computer.<br> I also liked playing light hearted pranks on others such as displaying random anonymous messages <br> on their devices through command prompt if they were connected to my internet.</p>
<br><br>
<p style="text-align: center;display:inline;color:rgb(244, 243, 242)">As time passed by, both passion and ambition grew, I had decided that I decided that I want to pursue avionics<br> engineering when I grow up, which includes the perfect balance of physics, cs and math I need. So as a hobby,<br> I took the intiative to take a small course in a full-stack web development course. Now, to keep my programming<br> skills sharp, I keep working on small projects, that become more complicated as they go on, as a matter of fact, this<br> is one of those projects. I hope you enjoy viewing my websites, and I will keep you posted on my newest creations!</p>
